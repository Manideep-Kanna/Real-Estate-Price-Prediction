# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building we will cover almost all **data science concepts** such as 


**1.Data loading  :** Loading of datasets into our pandas dataframe

**2.Data Cleaning :** Removing all null values or Replacing the null values with mean or median depending upon the feature.Removing the features which dont affect our  dependent variable. 

**3.Outlier Detection and Removal :**  Removing of odd values according to  **business logic** rules  and  using **mean** and **standard deviation** to **normalize** the values.

**4.Feature Engineering :** Extracting usefull entities from preexisting features which leads to make our model more accurate in terms of prediction of dependent variable.

**5.Dimensionality Reduction :** Reducing the categorical values for an specific categorical feature to decrease the no of features created during the **One Hot Encoding**

**6.One Hot Encoding :** Technique used to convert an categorical feature to numerical features where each numerical feature is an categorical value and the value of numerical feature is 1(Yes) or 0 (No)

**6. K fold cross validation :** Technique used to split the data into multiple splits each time a different split is used for training and testing.

**7.gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning :** Used to find which algorithm performs the best for the Problem statement and what are the best parameter value for that algorithm.


The code is fully functional and commented in such a way even an beginner could understand.

**NOTE:** I know the following project is an common project but I learned a lot from this project.
